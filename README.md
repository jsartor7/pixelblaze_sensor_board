Pixelblaze Sensor Expansion Board
-------------------

![sensor board](http://app.bhencke.com/pixelblaze/sb10b.jpg)

* A microphone and signal processing with frequency magnitude data ranging from 37Hz-10KHz designed to work in very loud environments
* A 3-axis 16G accelerometer
* An ambient light sensor
* 5 analog inputs that can be used with potentiometers or other analog inputs

[For sale on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/12158/)! Pick up this board and/or a Pixelblaze! Make cool sound-reactive LED things, or get one and hack the firmware!

I hope you find this useful or interesting. Maybe you hack your board? I'd be stoked to hear about it! Roll your own? Great! Turn it into a robot brain? Awesome!

Shout out to Sparkfun, their boards were used in the initial prototype, and their Eagle files were really helpful!

Shout out to [https://github.com/pyrohaz/STM32F0-PCD8544GraphicAnalyzer](https://github.com/pyrohaz/STM32F0-PCD8544GraphicAnalyzer) which does similar FFT stuff with a similar processor, even shares the fixed point FFT code in common!

Non-Pixelblaze Usage
-------------------
Looking to use this with an Arduino or Teensy or something? You just need a free serial port at 115200 baud.

The protocol is fairly simple:

1. Each frame starts with "SB1.0" including a null character (6 bytes).
2. The frequency information follows, as 32 x 16-bit unsigned integers.
3. Then is the audio energy average, max frequency magnitiude, max frequency Hz, all 3 as 16-bit unsigned ints.
4. Next the accelerometer information as 3 x 16-bit signed integers.
5. The data from the Light sensor is next, as a single 16-bit unsigned integer.
6. Followed by the 5 x 16-bit analog inputs (12-bit resolution, shifted up to 16 bits)
7. Finally "END" including a null character (4 bytes).
